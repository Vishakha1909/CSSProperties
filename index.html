    <h1>Fixed/sticky/…. positioning</h1>
    <p>I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new lines
    below me.</p>
    <p class="positioned">Now I'm absolutely positioned relative to the
    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, not the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element!</p>
    <p>We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are separated by the
    width of one of our margins, not both.</p>
    <p>inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same
    line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing
    inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line if possible — like this one containing
    text</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do: <img class = "img" src="unnamed.png"></p>
